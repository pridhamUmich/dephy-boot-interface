# Put the appropriate boot id in the left and right ids for the boots you are using.
# if these values you do not have their calibration numbers, do a data collection where you:
#    1. Hold the shoe fully dorsiflexed
#    2. Apply a motor current which tightens the strap.
#    3. Gradually dorsiflex the shoe till it is fully dorsiflexed
#    4. Stop the data collection
#    5. Use the exoTorqueCalcCal.m file changing the file path and file names.  This will produce the coefficients for this file which map the motor velocity to the ankle velocity.
#        - poly4 = coeff<side>(1) ;  poly3 = coeff<side>(2)  etc.
# These are the raw encoder values of a boot at its most plantar flexed position, which should be 55 degrees from the sole and shank of the boot being perpendicular.
